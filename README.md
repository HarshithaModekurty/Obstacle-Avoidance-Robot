# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

## Overview
This project showcases an autonomous obstacle avoidance robot using ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino Uno. The robot detects obstacles in its path and makes real-time decisions to avoid collisions by maneuvering around them.

## Features
- Real-time obstacle detection
- Autonomous navigation
- Simple and effective design using affordable components

## Key Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Power Supply

## Code
The code for this project is written in C++ for the Arduino platform. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure distances and sends signals to the motor driver to control the movement accordingly.

## How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensors continuously measure the distance to nearby obstacles.
2. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the robot makes a decision to turn left, right, or reverse.
3. The L298N motor driver receives signals from the Arduino to control the motors accordingly.

## Results
- Successfully avoided obstacles and navigated autonomously.
- Smooth real-time response to varying environments.
